\maketitle
Image interpolation techniques are used in medical imaging for image generation and processing. This paper compares seven asbects, and the comparison is done by spatial and Fourier analyses, computational complexity, runtime evalutions, qualitative and quantitative interpolation error determinations for particular interpolation tasks in medical image processing.\\
\section{INTRODUCTION}
Image interpolation has many application in computer vision. It is the first of the two basic resampling steps and transforms a discrete matrix into a continuous image. Then, sampling of this intermediate result produces the resampled discrete image. Image interpolation methods have occupied a peculiar position in medical image processing. They are necessary for image generation and image post-processing. \\

\section{INTERPOLATION TASKS IN MEDICAL IMAGING}
Image resampling is required for every geometric transform of discrete images. In this paper, we compare interpolation methods through simple expansions in one dimension and different rotations. Figure \ref{fig1} and Figure \ref{fig2} shows a digital photograph of a human eye. The positions of the Purkinje reflections within the pupil are used for strabometry.\\
